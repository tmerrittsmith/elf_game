    "I discovered the Elf Game as a maths teacher, a fun Christmas activity with a competitive edge. Players run a business where they make money by sending elves out to cut down christmas trees and sell them. Risks are associated with different tree locations, but with a greater reward. Players also have the opportunity to hire more elves. After being soundly beaten by some students, I decided to take revenge and solve the elf game. "
